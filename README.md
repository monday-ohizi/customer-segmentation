Repository: [https://github.com/monday-ohizi/customer-segmentation]

Overview

This project performs customer segmentation on wholesale customer data using unsupervised machine learning. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing patterns to support marketing, sales, and business strategy decisions.

The project is implemented in Python using pandas, scikit-learn, and matplotlib/seaborn.

Features

1. Loads and explores wholesale customer data (wholesale_customers.csv)

2. Cleans and preprocesses the data

3. Applies clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)

4. Visualizes clusters and interprets results

5. Provides actionable insights for business
